Assignment 3 of Machine Learning

 Because of the size of the two matrices X_Training and X_Test(and by consequence also the target matrices), it has been necessary to reduce them because the execution time was too long.
 We have tried different formats of the matrices, which are commented in the main file in order to try them.
 We have tried these combinations of n and m :
	- 1000 and 500
	- 2000 and 1000
	- 4000 and 2000
and produced for each one a table with the results of the accuracy in function of the digit (1,2,3,...) and of the value of k.
